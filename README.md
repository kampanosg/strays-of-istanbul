# strays-of-istanbul 🐈🐕
The source for the [strays-of-istanbul.xyz](https://strays-of-istanbul.xyz) website. Nothing too fancy, just a static website, with bare-minimum CSS and JS and that just shows a bunch of cat images. I call it simplicity... not that I have no idea how to make a website 🤫

## Hosting
The domain is pointing to an S3 bucket that is serving the static HTML (`index.html`) file. The assets are also stored there for simplicity and ease of access and use.

## Media
I am not a photographer and I don't own any professional equipment so all images have been shot on my iPhone 12 Pro Max. However, I did convert the original images to WEBP to save some some bandwitdth but the website can fallback to JPGEs, if a user visits using their microwave.
