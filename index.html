	    </h1>
            <p>I visited Istanbul in April 2023. It has been a trip that I always wanted to do and when the opportunity came up, I went for it without any hesitations.</p>
	    <p>And I am glad that I did! It is an amazing city, full of history, culture and amazing food.</p>
	    <p>However, I almost immediately noticed the large number of strays, and particularly cats. Thankfully, for the most part, locals seem to take care of them by leaving food - loads of chonky cats around! So while my friends were taking photos of the mosques and vast markets, I was capturing the life of the <i>strays of Istanbul</i>.</p>

            <p>This is Yoshi! He's not a stray, but we met in a coffee shop in Be≈üikta≈ü and he asked me if he could be featured here. I happily obliged!</p>
