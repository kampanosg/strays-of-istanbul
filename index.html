		        Strays of Istanbul

	        </h1>
            <p>I visited Istanbul in April 2023. It has been a trip that I always wanted to do. When the opportunity came up, I went for it without any hesitations.</p>
	        <p>And I am glad that I did! It is a beautiful city, full of history, culture, and amazing food.</p>
            <p>However, I almost immediately noticed a lot of strays, particularly cats. Thankfully, for the most part, locals look after them by leaving food - loads of chonky cats around! So while my friends were taking photos of the mosques and vast markets, I decided to capture the life of the <i>strays of Istanbul</i>.</p>

            <p>This is Yoshi! He's not a stray, but we met in a coffee shop in Be≈üikta≈ü and he asked me if he could be featured here. I happily obliged!</p>
